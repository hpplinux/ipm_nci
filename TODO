API refactoring:
----------------

1) env vars : user/center API
2) MPI_Pcontrol : hpcuser API
3) methods on task, job, and trace structs: internal API

parsing 

 to show a comparison of runs posited to represent
	1) the same work at differenent concurrencies on the same architecture
	ipm -compare=strong file1.xml file2.xml ...
	2) the same work at the same concurrency on different architectures
	ipm -compare=arch file1.xml file2.xml ...
	3) work proportional to concurrency on the same architecture
	ipm -compare=weak file1.xml file2.xml ...
	4) a bunch of runs, no task information
	ipm -compare=workload file1.xml file2.xml ...

Option to replace MPI_Waitall with an MPI_Waitany loop

remove as many popen calls as possible 

---

binary trace files
trace viewer 
trace hooks for running code -> tx
complete socket tree in ipm binary
remapper for postprocessing of logs to optimally remap task topology 


If regions are invoked on some tasks and not others then ipm_report will
deadlock.
