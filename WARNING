Hi, 

If you are a HPC application developer or user and want to use IPM to profile 
your code, you may want to enlist the help of a system administrator or HPC
engineer to get IPM installed. In its ideal form IPM exists as an easy to use
layer between applications and the parallel execution environment on a
particular machine.  Getting that layer implemented often involves many system
specific configuration choices that are best made on a per machine rather
than per user basis.

That said, IPM does not require root privleges and you can install it in your
own space. Several users have done just that, but doing so may require some
degree of thinking and planning outside of your particular application. 

The skill set that's required to install IPM is roughly:

  * an understanding the MPI implmentation that's being used
  * an understanding how parallel exeuction works (mpirun, PE, PBS, LL, etc.)
  * a working knowledge of MPI linkage and shared libraries
  * an understanding of the switch and nodenames on the system
  * identifying a location and method of writting logs files

If you have ideas about how to make IPM easier to install, they are certainly
welcome. 

Regards, 

the IPM developers
