1) You can download IPM from sourceforge

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ipm-hpc login 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ipm-hpc co -P ipm

or

export CVS_RSH=ssh 
cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ipm-hpc co -P ipm

2) ./configure - this should provide a basic working configuration.

Even better is if you can help IPM out a little eg:

./configure --with-os=LINUX --with-compiler=gcc --with-arch=LINUX --with-cpu=INTEL

this is especially important if you have a machine with several compilers installed.

 ./configure --help will provide a full set of options

If you are cross-compiling ie. the architecture of the compute portion of your 
machine is different from the login node the configure process can cause problems.
Please contact us for help if you encounter such problems.

3) make (or make shared if you plan to use LD_PRELOAD and libipm.so below).

4) make test - skip if integrating with system MPI 

	 Not sure to work on all platforms since the route to parallel 
	 execution is very site specific. If "make test" does not work 
         then try linking directly against libipm.a and running your code. 

5) install

	You can install libipm.a as a library to link applications against
	or what is preferable is to integrate IPM with you MPI library and/or
	parallel environment. This tends to be highly platform specfic. 

	LINUX:  1) link against -lipm
	 	2) relink your central MPI lib to include ipm hooks
		3) LD_PRELOAD libipm.so at runtime (in batch)
		
	ALTIX: LD_PRELOAD libipm.so at runtime

	AIX: make ibm 
	     cp ./lib/libmpi_r.a to $MYLIBAREA
	     where $MYLIBAREA is a directory that you will later 
             assign to MP_EUILIBPATH

I figure there is no practical way to autoconf this program since detection 
of MPI is complicated by batch execution. Someone prove me wrong please. 

6) Note: make clean will remove for recompilation
         make real-clean will remove for reconfiguration
